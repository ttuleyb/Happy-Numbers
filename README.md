# Happy-Numbers
A python program that checks if a number is a happy number or not.
A number is a happy number if:
When the sum of squares of its digits are calculated, the sum eventually becomes 1 without looping.

The programme finds first 8 happy numbers but this can be changed by editing the while loop.
