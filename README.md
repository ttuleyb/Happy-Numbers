# Happy-Numbers
A python program that checks whether a number is a happy number or not.

## What is a happy number?
A happy number is a number that is defined by the following process: starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

## Simpler explanation
When the sum of squares of its digits are calculated, the sum eventually becomes 1 without looping.

The script finds first N happy numbers.
